  subject: 'Unplugging the Web with Elixir'
  summary: |-
    Elixir has benefited from extensive prior art in the design of web application packages and frameworks, coming out of the rich ecosystems of both Erlang and Ruby. The benefits have been both direct and low-level in the case of Erlang (building on top of the Cowboy HTTP server), and indirect and high-level in the case of Ruby (drawing on Sinatra and Rails). All of these influenes have come together in the Phoenix Framework.

    Although Phoenix touts itself as a MVC framework, it is not strictly limited to the Model-View-Controller pattern. In fact, MVC is a simplistic shorthand that elides rather than clarifies Phoenix&#39;s full potential.

    This talk will peel back Phoenix&#39;s many layers and deconstruct its underlying asumptions. It will explore alternative patterns and architectural styles that can be used productively in Elixir web development.

  summary: |-
    We&#39;ve been debating on the concurrency solution of Ruby for several years. Numerous custom &quot;evented&quot; drivers have been built, but for most of these projects, developers are required to think in the &quot;evented&quot; way to get things work properly, which not only breaks the elegance of Ruby programming, but also greatly increases the complexity of the refactoring process.

    We will then think in Ruby, looking for the solution to make your whole web application &quot;evented&quot; with great meta-programming features of Ruby language itself. So that, you could still concentrate on your business models while programming as usual, but the performance may boost to 5 times faster or more without any hesitation.

We incorporated what we learned into a tool called devly. Devly is used to develop products at Fastly that span many services written in different languages.

    We learned that the design of our tools must be guided by how teams work and communicate. To respond to these needs, Devly allows self-service, control, and safety so that developers can focus on their work.

This system works fine, and, therefore, I think it is helpful for a person who wants to develop applications alike. Because this application almost includes all features of raspberry interfaces (besides GPIO), such as wifi, Bluetooth, touch screen, USB, database, voice, HDMI, so, it is a good practice to demonstrate the abilities about Elixir on raspberry. My goals in this talk are:
    (1) present it works,
    (2) appreciate to the forum, it is very helpful to me in developing,
    (3) announce a resource (me), I am glad to provide my experience to any person interested.

  summary: |-
    How do you install Ruby using any tools? There are various solutions such as installing the binary and building from the source package. Did you know how do these Ruby packages come from the Ruby core team? Did you know that you are being delivered to your hands?

    For example, if you are using macOS, you think that you are using third party tools like rvm, ruby-build, ruby-install. If you use Windows, You can choose RubyInstaller on Windows. Finally, If you use Linux, You didn’t need third party tool. You only use standard package manager on Linux.

    As standpoint of Ruby&#39;s Core team infrastructure, I will show you how Ruby&#39;s package was created and released at the time of release. In addition, I will introduce your selections of new Ruby experiences.
    Therefore, Ruby has a lot of build options for linking shared libraries, changing program name, and others. It’s a too complex thing. I will describe these details.

    In finally, I will introduce what kind of things inside ruby-build as a famous build tool for Ruby. It has a mechanism of building. I will explain these mechanism. After that, You can choose a best environment and options for your ruby experiences used ruby-build and Ruby packages.

  summary: |-
    There are more and more web applications with multi-tenant features these days. Such as online forums and e-commerce stores. To accelerate the development, major web frameworks often have multi-tenant plugins for fast-developing prototypes. The gem "Apartment" is the most representative one for Rails applications. It provides fast and isolated multi-tenant environments by making use of PostgreSQL schema functionality. However, when the number of schemas is too large, the drawbacks of using multi-schema database often outweigh the advantages it brings. In this talk, I will share my experience on using Apartment in a production project with over 130000 database schemas, and how I save the system from being paralyzed by the huge number of schemas.

  subject: "Don't Repeat Your Code Review Suggestion"
  summary: |-
    In software engineering, repeating things is usually considered harmful. We start our projects with a testing framework to keep running tests without repeating manually. Instead of copy and paste a code snippet, we define a method to make our code structured. When we find ourselves repeating a code review suggestion several times, we try some automation!

    This talk will cover the design and implementation of our review assistant tool, comparison with other LINT tools, and how our reviewing workflow has been changed.

  title: 'DevOps Engineer, Rakuten Inc.'
  bio: |-
    Tetsushi Awano joined Rakuten Travel in April 2012. Since 2016, I joined the DevOps team to support DevOps activity within the organisation. My hobby is cycling and having 環島 (Round trip around Taiwan) twice by bicycle. I am passionate about creating software which improves the productivity of the organisation.

    I was introduced to Ruby when I was lab student at Aoyama Gakuin University, Software Lab. The professor was Ruby commiter. Since joining Rakuten Travel in 2012, I was coding Java but started to use Ruby again from 2016.
  subject: 'How Ruby has dramatically improved the productivity of developers in Rakuten Travel'
  summary: |-
    When DevOps team was established in 2016, development teams in Rakuten Travel were working in silos. Development teams had had separate development processes (build-automation tool, release-automation tool, site-operation tool). Also the development environment which all teams used together had infrastructure restrictions and development processes which slowed down the development in the organization level.

    DevOps team talked with each development teams and found issues to solve. Then DevOps team standardised the development processes by delivering software in the topic of System/Application Data Centralisation, Multiple Development Environment, High Availability, Data Visualisation, Table Definition Management. Most of our software is written in Ruby. After 2 years of DevOps activity, all development teams follow the standardised development process. Also, operational processes such as release automation and site operation are now consolidated to 1 team. As a result the productivity of our organisation improved dramatically.

    In the process of developing software, DevOps team faced many issues. As many members did not have a developer background, we did not write unit-test for our Rails application. So we learned how to write rspec testcases and also introduced guard to achive TDD. Then, as the number of our Rails application increased, many duplicated codes exist such as getting server related information from cross-company internal API. So we learned to package duplicated code into rubygems and store it in internal gem repositories. When we faced a performance issue in our program, we tried to solve it by using multi-threading function. However Ruby was unfit for it and we ended up using Java instead.

    Another important part of this DevOps activity was to adapt the standardised software to each development team. Development teams had their own development processes which were already efficient for them. So when we tried to adapt the software, while most development teams were supportive, some were not. In the latter case, we had to do many of the heavy lifting such as making code changes to the product code and testing products on our own. The most difficult part was actually creating testcases and executing testcases which are normally responsible by other development teams. This is mentally tough but very challenging part of DevOps activity.

  subject: "Boost Your Daily Development with Ruby's AST Toolchains"
  summary: |-
    Ruby has toolchains to parse Ruby code into abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and process. Software such as [an IDE](http://rubykaigi.org/2017/presentations/mtsmfm.html), [a linter](http://rubykaigi.org/2017/presentations/p_ck_.html) or [a formatter](https://github.com/ruby-formatter/rufo)) is buit on them.
    But do you know these toolchains can be useful for <em>your own daily</em> development?
    This talk will show you how to boost your development with AST toolchains.

  subject: 'Practical High-Level Architecture: How to build the software that everyone will love'
  summary: |-
    Practical software engineering involves much more than just a technical framework – it encompasses processes, company culture, and individual team members’ technical abilities. In that sense, every company is like a living organism that is constantly changing under influence of internal and external factors. Due to the small size of our team and limited resources as a technical co-founder, I was forced to look for an optimal architecture and workflow which will allow implementing features according to the CEO’s vision with minimum friction and will distract the team on fixing bugs later on as less as possible at the same time.
    
    The journey began with using Trailblazer with Rails on the Ave88.com and continued with using DDD-Lite with the Phoenix on the Flowmail.com where it undergone a series of transformations.

    Our experience made us recognize that:
    - Any even moderate-size project can’t be based solely on MVC and Service Objects.
    - It’s possible to implement the practical and reliable architecture in both Rails and Phoenix framework, though some Rails conventions make process a little more tedious.
    - Having a right architecture is a long, time and resource consuming journey that will eventually pay off.
    - Changes should be supported at the management level since the governance style may be severely affected in the software development companies.

    The talk itself will consist of two parts: technical and non-technical both of which will underpin key points in implementing changes and will contain practical takeaways for a small-mid sized teams/projects.
    
    Noteworthy, some technics and conclusions were recognized and now going through the implementation evaluation on the larger, 200 KLOC RoR codebase.

  subject: 'Rails loves React'
  summary: |-
    In Rails 5.1, webpacker gem now directly supports Javascript front-end framework such as React and Angular.
    However, I am running React on the Docker environment without webpacker gem.
    React has many advantages for making dynamic views.
    Especially, One way flow provided by React is similar structure with Rails data flow.
    So It&#39;s easy to understanding for server side engineers.

    In this session, I will explain the purpose of using React in View, Pros &amp; Cons.
